# Formal-Verification-EVM-Opcodes
This repository contains implementations of projects designed to:
1- Understand the inner workings of the Solidity compiler and EVM opcodes. 
2- Develop smart contracts using Assembly and Yul for optimized and granular control.
3- Apply formal verification techniques to guarantee contract invariants using tools like Certora and Halmos.
